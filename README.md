# Photo Interrupter Sensor with LED Control

## Description

This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino with a photo interrupter sensor and an LED. The photo interrupter sensor detects changes in light intensity and triggers the LED accordingly. When the sensor is blocked, indicating an interruption in the light path, the LED turns on. Conversely, when the sensor is unblocked, the LED turns off.

## Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO**
2. **Photo Interrupter Sensor**
3. **LED**
4. **Jumper Wires**
5. **Breadboard**

## Instructions

### Circuit Wiring

1. **Connect the Photo Interrupter Sensor:**
   - Connect one leg of the photo interrupter sensor to digital pin 3 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the other leg of the photo interrupter sensor to GND on the Arduino.

2. **Connect the LED:**
   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to GND on the Arduino.

### Upload the Code

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new sketch.
3. Verify and upload the sketch to the Arduino board.

## Project Operation

- The photo interrupter sensor continuously monitors changes in light intensity.
- When the sensor detects an interruption in the light path (blocked), it triggers the LED to turn on.
- Conversely, when the sensor is unblocked, the LED turns off.

## Applications

1. **Object Detection:** Detecting the presence or absence of objects passing through a specific area.
2. **Security Systems:** Monitoring access points or detecting intrusions.
3. **Industrial Automation:** Controlling processes based on the presence or absence of objects.
