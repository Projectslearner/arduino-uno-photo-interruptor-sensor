# Arduino Uno Photo Interrupter Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Uno with a photo interrupter sensor. The sensor detects interruptions in its infrared beam caused by an object passing through its detection area. The Arduino reads the sensor's output to determine if an object is present or not.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Photo Interrupter Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Photo Interrupter Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal output pin of the photo interrupter sensor module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Ensure the VCC pin of the module is connected to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the GND pin of the module to GND on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the photo interrupter sensor module to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the messages on the Serial Monitor indicating whether an object is detected or not as you interrupt the sensor's beam.

#### Applications

- **Object Detection:** Use in applications requiring detection of objects passing through a specific point.
- **Counting Systems:** Implement in systems that count objects passing through a designated area.
- **Automation:** Trigger actions based on the presence or absence of objects in a defined space.

#### Notes

- Position the photo interrupter sensor and object correctly for reliable detection.
- Adjust the code or sensor position to optimize detection sensitivity based on your application requirements.
- Ensure the sensor is free from obstructions that could interfere with its operation.
